# ApiWars
## [Link to application](https://api-wars.azurewebsites.net)

My application uses the API from https://swapi.dev/ and displays it in the application view in well-formatted tables. 
Users can view data when they are not logged in, they can also register and log in. Logged in users can vote on any planet, and these votes are stored in the database. 
All users can check the current voting statistics.
Application server side is written in ASP.NET Core 3.1, I used MSSQL database and to consume and display api data I used JavaScript.
